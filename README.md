**FlashAlliance**
is a standalone ERC20-funded collective NFT trading module.
Each `Alliance` instance is a self-contained pool with fixed participants and fixed ownership shares.

**FlashAlliance** is designed as a lightweight, capital-efficient coordination layer for small groups that want to acquire and manage high-value NFTs together.

There is no global DAO dependency.
Each Alliance operates independently.

Note: Please read the Contract [Documentation](https://flash-docs.vercel.app) before integrating with this repo.

**Core Flow**

1. Participants deposit ERC20 in `Funding`.
2. Alliance buys NFT when target is reached.
3. Participants vote sale params in `Acquired`.
4. Sale executes and proceeds are split by fixed shares.
5. If funding fails, participants withdraw refunds.
6. Emergency NFT withdrawal is available via participant quorum.
