![FlashAlliance Banner](./docs/bert-alliances.png)

**FlashAlliance**
 is a standalone ERC20-funded collective NFT trading module.
Each `Alliance` instance is a self-contained pool with fixed participants and fixed ownership shares.

This module is intentionally separate from BERT core governance contracts.
In BERT terms, FlashAlliance should be treated as an ecosystem add-on product, not a core DAO primitive.
Administrative controls are local (`Ownable`) per alliance.

Note: Please read the Contract [Documentation](https://bertdao-docs.vercel.app) before integrating with this repo.

**Core Flow**

1. Participants deposit ERC20 in `Funding`.
2. Alliance buys NFT when target is reached.
3. Participants vote sale params in `Acquired`.
4. Sale executes and proceeds are split by fixed shares.
5. If funding fails, participants withdraw refunds.
6. Emergency NFT withdrawal is available via participant quorum.
